# hello-world
Just for fun!

Hello, I'm a super beginnger and i'm just trying to figure out how this works. 
So, I hope GitHub is a really cool place and it will be useful for me in future. 

Also I've just gave up my university. It means, I exit this place... Maybe it's a big mistake in my life. 
But I'm pretty sure, people are masters of their lifes. Am I wrong? We well see.
